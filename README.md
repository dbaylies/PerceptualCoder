# PerceptualCoder
A Basic perceptial coder for audio compression.

This coder uses several techniques to optimizes its audio compression, including:
- dynamic quantization
- transient detection
- perceptual model

To code an audio file, call mdct_coder(ifile,quantmode), where:
- ifile is input *.wav file
- quant_mode is:
  - 0:   no quantization
  - 1:   quantize Thr and MDCT coefs
